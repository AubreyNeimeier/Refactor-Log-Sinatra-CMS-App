### Summary ###
Refactor Log allows programmers to log their projects and the code within that needs refactoring. Any code, whether it is a single line or an entire method that needs work is a "concern" in Refactor Log. A user enters details about the projects and concerns and can track and save them for reference. The goal of this app is to help programmers stay more organized and to help them debug projects more efficiently. A user only needs a username and password to register.
